# DECO3850 - Interstellar

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to work through the principles of physical computing and so to develop a mixed reality program about astronomy. This program supports the recognition of human gestures as well as body movements and also reads data from sensors. Virtual modelling was using Unity as a modelling tool while physical modelling was using fusion 360 as a modelling tool. Moreover, code libraries such as OpenVC, Mediapipe, and Sket were used to implement real-time tracking and recognition of human gestures and body movements.

## Usage
1. `$ pip install numpy`
2. `$ pip install opencv-python`
3. `$ pip install mediapipe`
4. `$ pip install scikit-learn`

Note: In case of mediapipe errors on Linux systems, try running `pip install mediapipe==0.10.7` in the terminal to fall back to a previous version.
